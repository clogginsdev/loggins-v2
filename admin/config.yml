              average project I was getting. My search for something more
              efficient kept leading me to Webflow. Admittedly, I had learned
              Webflow and even taught other designers how to use it, but I
              didn’t become a Webflow customer until I was transitioning out of
              my agency job. Now, I use Webflow for just about all my projects.,

              Original text: Mr. Small had been trying for years to get a
              website up and running, but often found himself getting caught in
              the day-to-day responsibilities of operating his business or was
              frustrated with lack of knowledge on how to achieve results he
              wanted. After working together over the course of several weeks,
              we went through countless mockups and content revisions until
              finally landing on something that stuck. During the middle of the
              design phase, Mr.Small decided to rebrand when he aquired a new
              business partner: his son! I went back to the drawing board and
              worked tirelessly until I came up with a design they both liked.

              Original text: Orginally, the website was build in WordPress, but
              Mr.Small was not as tech-savvy as his son and wanted to be able to
              edit the site on his own. After looking through various options,
              we decided that building in Webflow would be the best way to go
              about this. Not only did this make editing the site easy for
              Mr.Small, but he no longer had to worry about finding a hosting
              service or platform updates., key: 60a3d43e

              showcases knowledge and inspiration in an accessible manner to
              audiences all across YouTube. It features bold colors that are

              wasn't providing those things so we decided to do something about
              it - his site would be built with Webflow! The interface is easy
              enough for Sef to have complete control over his site while also
              being able to extend its function as needed without losing
              anything in quality or importance of information on any one page.,

              Original text: With a business on the rise, VAAYS was in need of
              an updated identity. The goal for this project was to create
              feelings of quality and trustworthiness while adding just enough
              modernity to fit with their message that they help clients do more
              without stressing as much about it. Blue and green were chosen as
              the main colors because these are synced with both their mission
              statement- which is "to make businesses grow by doing less." The
              yellow helps you get your attention. The checkmark, while not a
              logo in the traditional sense, drove home the point of 'checking
              things off your list' and lowercase type added to that
              approachable feel., key: -50887129

              Original text: VAAYS originally built their website on Wix, but
              they soon realized that it wouldn't cut for the backend
              functionality that they wanted. They also needed to integrate
              certain apps on their backend that would be native to their
              website’s platform. What was their solution? I developed a
              WordPress site in Webflow using the Udesly Adapter. This allowed
              VAAYS to use some of the technologies from back end while
              retaining ease of content management with Webflow., key: -7b48efe6
